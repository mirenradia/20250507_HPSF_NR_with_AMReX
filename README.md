# Numerical Relativity with AMReX

This repository contains the code to generate the slides for my presentation
about "Numerical Relativity with AMReX" delivered by Miren Radia at the [HPSF
Conference 2025](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/hpsf-conference/) on Wed 7
May 2025.

## Quarto

These slides are written in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) markdown in the
[Reveal.js](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) format.

### Build

To generate the slides, [install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
and then execute

```
quarto render slides.qmd
```

It should generate a `slides.html` file which you can open with a web browser.

### GitHub Pages

I will publish the slides to the GitHub pages site associated to this
repository.
